# FAQ
### What is a trigger key? Can I change it?
Trigger key signals the start of a keyword for searching kaomojis. With double trigger key enabled, you can start searching kaomojis by entering the key twice.
You can update your trigger key in Peachy's Preferences pane. Keep your key unique with a single special character or a punctuation mark.

### I open Peachy and nothing shows up.
Peachy is a menu bar app, you can find it as a peach icon on the menu bar of your machine.
Can't find it? When the menu bar has no space left, macOS hides overflowing items. Try quitting some other menu bar apps.

### Why is this free without ads?
I love making apps. Share Peachy with your friends! If you're feeling generous, consider buying me a coffee/cocktail [here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/itsmeichigo).

### Do you track usage data in this app?
No data is tracked in Peachy. 
You can even disable crash reports if you prefer, but I need them to monitor and improve the app performance.
